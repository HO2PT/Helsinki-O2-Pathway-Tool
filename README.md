# Helsinki O2 Pathway Tool

The HO2PT is intended to be used to analyze V̇O2, its components, and their alterations of a single test subject or a group-level dataset. It is intended to be used as a tool for anyone researching V̇O2, for example, in the fields of scientific research, education, athlete’s physical performance testing and coaching. It can also be used in research of pulmonary, cardiovascular, and skeletal muscle conditions and disorders, for example, for identifying and monitoring factors limiting aerobic capacity and physical performance. Thus, if the tool and the information it provides will be demonstrated by future peer-reviewed original studies to be suitable for appropriate patient groups in clinical patient work as a part of diagnostics, monitoring, and decision-making, one of its intended use environments may be clinical patient work in the future. The tool can also be used to study effects of environmental factors and medications on physiological responses.

<h3>What kind of data can I use?</h3>

The tool can read and save excel-files (.xlsx). Your data can be formatted in multiple ways and have multiple sheets, 
that is why O2PathwayTool has an importing tool which guides you through the importing process. 

<h3>How about exporting results?</h3>

The O2PathwayTool makes a copy of your data, so you don't have to worry about overriding your existing data. Results can be 
exported into a new excel file or they can be concatenated to the same file that was used to import data.

<h3>Do I need measurement data?</h3>

No. You can create projects, subjects, tests and input data by hand.
