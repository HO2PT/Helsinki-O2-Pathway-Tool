# O2PathwayTool

O2PathwayTool is a tool for modeling oxygen pathway visually and numerically with non-invasive or invasive measurement data.
The tool combines Fick's law of diffusion and Fick's principle to calculate oxygen diffusion in the muscle. The model estimates
partial pressure of oxygen in venous blood taking also the core temperature and arterial blood's pH into account. The tool was 
designed and developed as a healthtech engineering bachelor's thesis work. The tool was designed and developed in collaboration 
with exercise physiologists in Helsingin Urheilulääkäriasema in Helsinki, Finland.

The O2PathwayTool uses information about (at least): 
- oxygen consumption (VO2)
- heart rate (HR)
- stroke volume (Sv)
- cardiac output (Q)
- hemoglobin concentration ([Hb])
- oxygen saturation of arterial blood (SaO2). 

You can also input information about:
- oxygen content of arterial blood (CaO2)
- oxygen content of venous blood (CvO2)
- difference of oxygen content in arterial-venous blood (CavO2)
- oxygen saturation of venous blood (SvO2)
- partial pressure of oxygen in venous blood (PvO2)
- oxygen convection (QaO2)
- core temperature
- pH

What kind of data can I use?

The tool can read and save excel-files (.xlsx). Your data can be formatted in multiple ways and have multiple sheets, 
that is why O2PathwayTool has an importing tool which guides you through the importing process. 

How about exporting results?

The O2PathwayTool makes a copy of your data, so you don't have to worry about overriding your existing data. Results can be 
exported into a new excel file or they can be concatenated to the same file that was used to import data.

Do I need measurement data?

No. You can create projects, subjects, tests and input data by hand.
